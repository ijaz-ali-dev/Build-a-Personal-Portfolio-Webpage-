# Build-a-Personal-Portfolio-Webpage-

I completed my final HTML and CSS project.
The webpage consists of four main sections: About, Blog, Projects, and Contact. The navigation bar is always at the top of the viewport. You click on links to navigate to different sections of the page. I used media queries for mobile phones with smaller displays to adjust the webpage layout.
